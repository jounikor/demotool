A demotool for remote execution of Amiga exes and ADFs
over the network from a PC/Mac/Amiga..

Currently implemented:
* Client for sending / reading files 
  - Compiles on Amiga (kick 2.x required)
  - Compiles on Mac etc Berkeley sockets compliant OSes.
  - Default plugin commands: lsg0, lsg1, adr0, adf0
  - Default remote commands: reboot, quit
  - Generic plugin commands: recv, send
    - Recv works like a 'peek' plugin.
    - Send works like a 'lsg0' plugin.
    - When using generic plugins you need to pass the plugin
      name to be used with '--plugin' option.

* server
  - Compiles on Amiga (kick 2.x required)

* plugins
  - Loadseg() executable launcher. 
  - Absolute address launcher. This plugin can be used to load
    arbitrary data into server Amiga RAM.
  - ADF writer. This allow 160 track ADF or 1 track ADF (for writing bootblock).
  - Peek to read arbitrary data from Server Amiga RAM to a
    client side file.

* About plugin implementations:
  If you do not want to change the client code then design your plugins
  to work with generic plugin commands 'recv' and 'send'. In this case
  the plugin logic must follow the 'lsg0' or 'peek' plugins documented
  in the 'inc/protocol.h' header file.

  Why the whole plugin hassle anyway? Erm.. no particular reason other 
  than I wanted to try out writing fancy plugin system. The way it is
  done is used in other forms and projects already.

* Acknowledgements:
  - A big credit goes to SDI's (Dirk Stoecker) existing work on plugins.
  - Olaf Barthel for pointing out some stupid "misconcepts" with blocking
    sockets.

Work in Progress:
* Generic cleanup of the code. It is rather messy in places.
