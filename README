A demotool for remote execution of Amiga exes and ADFs
over the network from a PC/Mac/Amiga..

Currently implemented:
* Client for sending / reading files 
  - Compiles on Amiga (kick 2.x required)
  - Compiles on Mac etc Berkeley sockets compliant OSes.

* server
  - Compiles on Amiga (kick 2.x required)

* plugins
  - Loadseg() executable launcher. 
  - Absolute address launcher. This plugin can be used to load
    arbitrary data into server Amiga RAM.
  - ADF writer
  - Peek to read arbitrary data from Server Amiga RAM to a
    client side file.

Work in Progress:
* Generic cleanup of the code. It is rather messy in places.
* Add function documentation.
* InternalLoadSeg() executable launcher (just for the sake of it ;)
